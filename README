Drake Framework - Zend Framework extension
==========================================

Drake Framework has been built with the goal of providing a common codebase
for custom projects. It is not intended to deliver RAD or fast processing,
but to provide additional utility.

ROADMAP
=======

The library as it stands now in GitHub is largely incomplete. Some components
have moved in a direction I dislike and would like to update them prior to
making them open source.

CREDITS
=======

Most components in Drake have been developed by Rob Zienert. But since it is a
compilation library, it also has contributions from other developers as well.
In these exceptions, the original authors are given due credit in the docblocks.
