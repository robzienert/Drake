Drake - Zend Framework extension
================================

Drake is a collection of Zend Framework extensions that provide me a common
codebase for custom projects.

ROADMAP
=======

The library as it stands now in GitHub is largely incomplete. Some components
have moved in a direction I dislike and would like to update them prior to
making them open source.

CREDITS
=======

Most components in Drake have been developed by Rob Zienert. But since it is a
compilation library, it also has contributions from other developers as well.
In these exceptions, the original authors are given due credit in the docblocks.
