Drake is a compilation library of Zend Framework extensions.

Most components in Drake have been developed by Rob Zienert. But since it is a
compilation library, it also has contributions from other developers as well
that I have taken over to either fit my needs or simply maintain. In these
exceptions, the original authors are given due credit.
